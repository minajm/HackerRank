# A bag contains 3 red marbles and 4 blue marbles. Then, 2 marbles are drawn from the bag, at random,
# without replacement. If the first marble drawn is red, what is the probability that the second marble is blue?

# Answers: In total there are 7 marbles, one of them was picked up so the 6 marbles exist in total which is two of
# them red and four of them blue.
# therefore the answer is 4/6 or 2/3
print('Answer is: 2/3 or ', round(2/3, 2))
